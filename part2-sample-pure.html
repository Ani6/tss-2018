            <p>Currently, I am a student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, in the Mechanical Engineering department. I'm scheduled to receive my Bachelor's in 2020,
        so right now, I'm just another sophomore at this massive institute.</p>
            <p>I love Trains. And Aircraft. Probably heavy machinery in general too! When I entered the institute as an Aerospace Engineering student, I always knew that I wanted to
        do something related to machines, though I already loved computers. If I remember correctly, I wrote my first "Hello World" program when I was a fifth grader, and since then,
        I've never stopped taking up tougher challenges. Now, the more I delve into these two fields, the more I get engrossed in them! My current goal is to find
        topics to work on, where I can make a combined use of my knowledge from both of these.</p>

            <p>I like to learn. It is one of the few things I really believe (and hope) I'm good at. For every situation that presents itself to me, I try to analyze
         and find out how I could have handled it better, once it gets sorted out. And I try to learn from others too!
         I really don't believe in re-inventing the wheel, and for this reason, I always try to stick to the MIT or Apache License.</p>
            <p>I like change. As the phrase goes, it is truly the only constant in this world. Even the value of &pi;, as we know it, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_computation_of_%CF%80" target="_blank">keeps getting more accurate!</a></p>
            <p>I swim, I write and (though people keep doubting that) I'm crazy about food! I love music!
        In my pas-time, you might find me at my laptop, walking down to nowhere, humming to the tunes I love or just admiring the lush greenery of our campus.
